Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my keen interest in the position of <position> at <company>.
Recently graduated from the Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya in Barcelona, with multiple high grades (average 8.28) and honor mentions, I recently moved back to Brussels and I am eager to bring my skills and passion to your esteemed organization.

Upon reviewing your job posting, it became evident that this role aligns perfectly with my qualifications, experiences, and professional preferences. My expertise in Python and C++, coupled with practical experience, positions me as an ideal candidate for this position.

Throughout my previous work experiences, I have used C++11 to lead the design and development of software compatible across multiple architectures of microcontrollers interconnected using Wifi and BLE. This involved creating a seamless connection between physical products and web interfaces through a Python backend featuring a REST API made with Flask.

Additionally, during my internship at HP, I utilized C++17 to implement new features for a slicing software designed for SLS 3D printers, demonstrating my ability to design efficient algorithms for 3D models.

I am confident that my proficiency in Python and C++, along with my hands-on experience, makes me well-equipped to contribute effectively to the innovative projects within <company>.

I look forward to the opportunity for further discussion and am available at your earliest convenience for an interview. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
